# What is Twevals?

Twevals is a lightweight, code-first evaluation framework for testing AI agents and LLM applications. Write evaluations like you write tests.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Pytest-Inspired" icon="flask-vial">
    Familiar patterns for Python developers. Use decorators, parametrize tests, and run from the CLI.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Simple by Design" icon="sparkles">
    Minimal boilerplate, sensible defaults, and an intuitive API that gets out of your way.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Built-in Web UI" icon="browser">
    View, filter, edit, and export results without separate tools. No setup required.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Production Ready" icon="rocket">
    Concurrent execution, timeouts, error handling, and flexible scoring systems.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Why Twevals?

Most evaluation frameworks require configuration files, complex setup, or force you into rigid patterns. Twevals takes a different approach:

```python
from twevals import eval, EvalContext

@eval(dataset="customer_service")
async def test_refund_request(ctx: EvalContext):
    ctx.input = "I want a refund for my order"
    ctx.add_output(await my_agent(ctx.input))
    ctx.add_score("refund" in ctx.output.lower(), "Contains refund mention")
```

That's it. No config files. No boilerplate. Just write your evaluation logic and run it.

## Key Features

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Code-First Approach">
    Write evaluations as Python functions with the `@eval` decorator. No YAML, no JSON configs, just code.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Smart Context Injection">
    The `EvalContext` automatically injects into your functions and handles result building for you.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Flexible Scoring">
    Boolean pass/fail, numeric scores, multiple metrics per evaluation—use whatever makes sense.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Parametrized Tests">
    Generate hundreds of test cases from a single function with `@parametrize`.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Web UI Included">
    Pass `--serve` and get a full-featured UI for viewing, filtering, and editing results.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Async Support">
    Works seamlessly with both sync and async functions. Just write your code naturally.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Quick Example

```python
from twevals import eval, parametrize, EvalContext

@eval(dataset="sentiment", default_score_key="accuracy")
@parametrize("text,expected", [
    ("I love this product!", "positive"),
    ("This is terrible", "negative"),
    ("It's okay I guess", "neutral"),
])
async def test_sentiment_analysis(ctx: EvalContext):
    result = await analyze_sentiment(ctx.text)
    ctx.add_output(result)
    ctx.add_score(result == ctx.expected, f"Expected {ctx.expected}")
```

Run it:

```bash
twevals examples/ --serve
```
